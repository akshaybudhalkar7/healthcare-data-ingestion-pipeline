# AWS ETL Project with Reporting

This repository contains an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project implemented on AWS. The project involves ingesting data from a source (Amazon RDS), performing transformations using AWS Glue, storing the processed data in Amazon S3, loading it into Amazon Redshift, and generating reports using Amazon QuickSight.

## Project Components

- **AWS Glue ETL Job:** The ETL process is orchestrated using AWS Glue, a fully managed ETL service. The Glue Job extracts data from Amazon RDS, transforms it, and loads the results into Amazon S3.

- **Amazon S3 Storage:** Amazon S3 serves as the intermediate storage for the transformed data. The data is stored in a structured format for further processing.

- **Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse:** The transformed data is loaded into Amazon Redshift, a fully managed data warehouse, allowing for high-performance querying and analytics.

- **Amazon QuickSight Reporting:** Amazon QuickSight is utilized for creating dashboards and reports based on the data stored in Amazon Redshift. The reports provide visualizations and insights for data analysis.

## Directory Structure


Certainly! Writing a clear and informative README is crucial for any GitHub repository. Here's a template for a README description for your ETL project with reporting on AWS:
